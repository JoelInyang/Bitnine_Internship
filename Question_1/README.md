# Arithmetic Expression Tree - Fibonacci Calculator

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using an expression tree and arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

## Development Environment

The code was developed and tested in the following environment:

- Operating System: Windows 11(But works well with windows 10 as well)
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) 9.3.0
- IDE: Visual Studio Code (Optional) [Alternatives are: Codeblocks or Gitbash]

## Compilation

To compile the source code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal (command prompt) on your computer.

2. Navigate to the directory where the source code file `fibonacci.c` is located using the `cd` command. For example:
cd path/to/source/code

3. Compile the source code using the GCC compiler with the following command:
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c


This command compiles the source code and produces an executable file named `fibonacci` which would likely have a green color when you use 'ls' command.

## Running the Program

Once you have compiled the program, you can run it using the following steps:

1. In the same terminal, run the compiled executable:
./fibonacci


2. The program will calculate the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming and arithmetic operations. It will display the results of various operations, including addition, multiplication, subtraction, and the final Fibonacci value.

3. After the program has finished running, you will see the calculated values displayed on the screen.

## Cleaning Up

After running the program, you can clean up any generated files using the following steps:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the same directory where the source code is located.

2. Run the following command to remove the compiled executable:
rm fibonacci



## Additional Notes

- The program may be executed in a different development environment, but the steps provided here assume a Unix-like terminal environment (Linux or macOS). If you are using a different operating system or development environment, adjust the commands accordingly.

- You can modify the expressions and arithmetic operations in the `main` function of the source code (`fibonacci.c`) to experiment with different calculations.
